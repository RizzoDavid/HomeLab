#Ansible
I already have ESXI as a Hypervisor and then Winodws Server installed on another system. To manage all of my future virtual machines, I am going to use ansible. That is the fist VM I am creating. Below are listed the spcecs: 
<ul>
    <li>2 vCPUs</li>
    <li>4 GB Ram</li>
    <li>25GB Hard Disk</li>
</ul>
